This folder contains all the data needed to reproduce Figures 3 and 4. For Figure 3, data files are labelled *_stats.dat where * indicates the number of TPCV and whether the TRA was used. These files are in column format.

The following are columns of interest:
Column # Quantitity
1        time
2        avg T
3        v RMS
4        top Nu
5        bottom Nu
11       avg C
12       entrainment for z>0.2
13       # of tracer-free CVs
14       min TPCV
15       max TPCV

For Figure 4, mass errors were found using the avg C value from the *_stats.dat files described above. The energy errors are given in the energy_error.dat file. The energy error data for all 6 models in the plot are contained in a single file, with two blank lines separating the different models. The order of energy_error.dat from first to last lines in the file is: 10TPCV, 30TPCV, 60 TPCV, 10TPCV_TRA, 30TPCV_TRA, and 60TPCV_TRA.
