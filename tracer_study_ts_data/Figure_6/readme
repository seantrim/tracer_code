This folder contains all the data needed to reproduce Figure 6. Time series data files are labelled *_stats.dat where * indicates the number of TPCV, the nz value and whether the TRA was used. These files are in column format.

The following are columns of interest:
Column # Quantitity
1        time
2        avg T
3        v RMS
4        top Nu
5        bottom Nu
11       avg C
12       entrainment for z>0.2
13       # of tracer-free CVs
14       min TPCV
15       max TPCV

Mass errors were found using the avg C value from the *_stats.dat files described above. The energy errors are given in the *_energy_error.dat files, where * indicates the number of TPCV, the nz value and whether the TRA was used. In those files column 1 is time and column 2 is the energy error.
